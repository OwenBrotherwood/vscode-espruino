# Espruino for VS Code

This is a plugin that allows you to write and deploy code to your Espruino micro controller.

# How to use it

Once installed into VS Code you'll find a bunch of new commands prefixed with `Espruino` that you can run.

# Deving the extension

This extension is very much a WIP, and due to [this vscode issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/658) running native node extenions is a bit tricky. At the moment I'm running it using the `electron-rebuild` command which seems to work _pretty well_ but it may not be great for you.
